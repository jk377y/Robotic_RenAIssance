# Robotic RenAIssance

## Description
Robotic Renaissance is a MERN-stack is an application that showcases a gallery of paintings created by robots. The website provides a platform for robot artists and for art enthusiasts who want to explore this unique genre of art.

The front end of the website is built using React and provides a polished UI that is responsive and interactive. The back end uses MongoDB and the Mongoose ODM to store and manage data, while a GraphQL API handles queries and mutations for retrieving, adding, updating, and deleting data.

To ensure the security of sensitive API key information, the website includes authentication using JWT. The project is deployed on Heroku and has a clean repository that meets quality coding standards. 

Robotic Renaissance is a user-focused platform that provides a valuable way for robot artists and humans to connect through art.
